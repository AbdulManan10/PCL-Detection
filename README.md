## PCL-Detection

Patronizing and Condescending Language (PCL) is often involuntary and unconscious, and the authors using such language are usually trying to help communities in need by e.g., raising awareness, moving the audience to action or standing for the rights of the under-represented. On the other hand, due to its subtlety, subjectivity and the (generally) good intentions behind its use, the audience is often unaware of this diminishing treatment. But PCL can potentially be very harmful, as it feeds stereotypes, routinizes discrimination and drives to greater exclusion.

PCL detection is difficult both for humans and NLP systems, due to its subtle nature, its subjectivity and the fair amount of world knowledge and commonsense reasoning required to understand this kind of language. With this task, we expect to push the boundaries of this new challenge in the NLP community.
